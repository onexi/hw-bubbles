To TA:
The js file to execute the funcitons from exercise one to nine is "generate.js"
- generate.js will callback the scripts in exercise.js and export the results of exercise.nine in another file called 'scores.js'
- The BubbleDisplay.html is the result of graph, and the bubble has been optimized with its bubble radius, 
the color category (more colors to cover all the word lengths), and total the size of the image

1. Execute generate.js-->scores.js will be generated accordingly
2. Open BubbleDisplay.html in the browser-->the html page will dislay the results from scores.js file
